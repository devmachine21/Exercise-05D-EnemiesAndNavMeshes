## Future Development

* Redo The Materials
* Redo The Movement Code
* Redo the gameplay loop
* Redo the horribly cursed maze prefab because who in their right mind would put 1 maze piece into 16 different prefabs and not make any of them a prefab variant
* How much am I going to have to recode? probably a lot... Oh well :3
